<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey there, am Sobowale Favour Olawunmi by the name, I was born on the 12 October 2004.My dad is an Yoruba man from ogun state , while my mom is from the South , Abia, Ngwa Isila. I left my parent home at the age of 5, and stayed with my grandparents up till date. My grandparents sponsor me to school, and i was able to complete my primary and secondary school here in lagosüòå. During my Ss3, to be frank , i didnt have a dream of what i will become, or sat myself down thinking of how my life will be in the next 10-15 years. My thought was i will just go for whatever my grandparents want, by becoming a professional medical doctor. After writing my jamb in the year 2024. My intention was after completing the jamb exam, i will go to Olabisi Onabanjo to study medcine
    .After seeing my jamb results, i didnt reach the cut off marks. I was idle at home for almost few months till my garndparent told me there was a Polytechnic in lagos and i should enroll, i did and that was how my Life started
 . I got Admission into that Polytechnic and i found out they only offer few courses which was <strong>Accountancy, Computer science, Business Adminstration and OTM </strong> I had no choice than to go for computer science, during my Nd1 in the school, i gained nothing because i had no intrest in it. During our Nd2 first semester, we went for a 3 month Siwes, during that time, a friend of mine who is a mentor to me gave me Angela Yu Web Developemnt Courses, making the student from the beginning level to the expert, i decided to be focus and i gain alot from her class, and it trigger me to learn and  practice more. In 2025, i found my dream in becoming a software developer and a web developer , i will love to create stunning website for my clients either outside the country or here in Nigeria.
    And been a software developer , I also want to be writing programs and creating apps for ios usersüòä.  </p><hr>
